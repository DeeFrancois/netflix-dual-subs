#### *Does NOT Work for languages with subtitles that are inserted with images since the browser can't detect those*
<sup>(This includes: Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Thai, Traditional Chinese, Vietnamese)</sup>

## Motivation
I'm learning Norwegian and I've found that dual subtitles are a really great language learning tool. Many people tend to watch shows with native subs on while using a seperate tab to constantly look up words they don't know. Dual subtitles improves this process by bringing translations to the video. 

After successfully adding dual subs to NRK TV with my [previous extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nrk-tv-language-learning/lmjfcijpnghdkpnoakgljodpjnimbakp), I figured I'd try making it work for Netflix as well so more people can benefit from this functionality.

## How to use
- Turn on the subtitles for your target langauge
- Right click the page and select "Translate to ____"
- That's it! You can click the extension button at the top to adjust the font size and opacity. There are also two added buttons for adjusting font size so you can still do so while in fullscreen.

## There are plenty of Netflix Dual Subtitle Extensions already, why should I use this?
Unfortunately the other extensions are either sketchy/not open-source, or they're just too obtrusive. I wanted something more lightweight that felt like I was just watching Netflix normally rather than using a full blown language learning program.

Also, the other extensions work by downloading both language subtitle files and displaying them. The problem with this is that the subtitles are based on the audio tracks in the respective language. This means that often times the subtitles are entirely different sentences rather than direct translations. (This is why they usually need a "hover for translation feature")

While that is great for beginners getting familiar with the language, I feel like direct translations are better for active learning.

## More rambling

**Google Translate is not perfect! Obviously, this should not be your only language learning tool.

Netflix tends to hide most subtitle languages by default. However, if you find the titles through https://netflix.com/browse/subtitles after selecting your target language, it will allow you to still use the hidden languages. For example, if I go to watch "After Life" it only shows French and Spanish, but if I use that link, select Italian, After Life shows up with Italian subtitles enabled.
