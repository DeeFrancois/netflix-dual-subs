v1.2.5: Feedback button

v1.2.6: 
##### Unfortunately, the Microsoft Edge Translator is just not nearly as fast or reliable as Google Translate. The update will make this extension at least "work" with Edge, in case the Edge translator improves in future, but for now I won't advertise that it is "Edge compatible". 

## Motivation
I'm learning Norwegian and I've found that dual subtitles are a really great language learning tool. Many people tend to watch shows with native subs on while using a seperate tab to constantly look up words they don't know. Having dual subtitles makes that process more efficient by bringing the translations directly onto video. 

After successfully adding dual subs to NRK TV with my [previous extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nrk-tv-language-learning/lmjfcijpnghdkpnoakgljodpjnimbakp), I figured I'd try making it work for Netflix as well so more people can benefit from this functionality.

## How to use
- Turn on the subtitles for your target langauge
- Right click the page and select "Translate to ____"
- That's it! You can click the extension button at the top to adjust the text color, font size, and opacity. There are also two added buttons for adjusting font size so you can still do so while in fullscreen.

## There are plenty of Netflix Dual Subtitle Extensions already, why should I use this?
Unfortunately the other extensions are either sketchy/not open-source, cost money, or just too obtrusive. I wanted something more lightweight that felt like I was still watching Netflix normally rather than using a full blown language learning program.

Also, the other extensions work by downloading both language subtitle files and displaying them. The problem with this is that the subtitles are based on the audio tracks of the respective language. This means that often times the subtitles are entirely different sentences from eachother rather than direct translations. (This is why they usually need a "hover for translation feature")

While that is great for beginners getting familiar with the language, I feel like direct translations are better for active learning.

## More rambling

Incase you didn't know, you can browse for shows by subtitle/audio language here https://www.netflix.com/browse/subtitles. Finding a show through there will actually enable audio/subtitle tracks that are hidden by default. (But just putting the language in the search bar is better for finding actual foreign shows).

** You can also watch shows in your native language and then tell your browser to translate the secondary subtitles into whatever language you're learning (including languages that I said aren't supported). But I don't know if that's an effective way to learn and it's too many steps to ask of people so I don't advertise it as a main feature.

Google Translate is not perfect! The accuracy is fine for me, but I'm someone that already knows enough to notice the mistakes. The benefit of using the other dual subs extensions is that you are guaranteed to get sentences that make sense even if they aren't direct translations.
