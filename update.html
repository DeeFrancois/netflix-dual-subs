    <h1>Dual Subtitles for Netflix has been Updated!</h1>

    <font size= "+1"><p> + You can now customize the left side text as well so it's easier to focus on</p> 
    <p> + Support for Microsoft Edge <br> <sub>Microsoft Edge can stream Netflix in 1080p+ while Google Chrome is actually limited to 720p. However, I'm not sure how the Edge translator compares to Google Translate. Seems alright so far.</sub> </p>
    <p> + The extension no longer breaks when the next episode autoplays. Oops, I wanted to get the last update out as fast as possible and missed that issue.</p>
    <p> + Fixed the unusual behavior when using the button to turn off the extension. </p>

    <p> Sorry for this annoying popup, I'll figure out a better way to notify you all next time.</p>
